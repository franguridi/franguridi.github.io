				<u>Abstract</u>
			</summary>
				<b>Background</b>
				<br>
				Multiple disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer’s disease are currently in clinical development or have been recently approved for use. They have vastly different treatment properties but so far, little work has been done to quantify the impact of treatment properties on the treatment’s value in terms of medical and social care costs and caregiver burden.
				<br>
				<b>Objectives</b>
				<br>
				This study aims to analyze how the mode of treatment administration, treatment frequency and duration, and monitoring requirements affect the value of disease modifying treatments. In order to isolate these effects, we compare five hypothetical disease modifying treatments with equal efficacy and safety: (1) chronic bi-weekly intravenous infusion, (2) chronic four-weekly intravenous infusion, (3) 52 weeks fixed duration four-weekly intravenous infusion, (4) chronic subcutaneous injections, and (5) chronic oral prescription on their direct medical costs, caregiver burden, and preservation of treatment value.
				<br>
				<b>Design</b>
				<br>
				Survey of Alzheimer’s disease treatment clinics and retrospective data analysis.
				<br>
				<b>Setting</b>
				<br>
				United States.
				<br>
				<b>Measurements</b>
				<br>
				Direct medical cost and caregiver burden of treatment administration and monitoring compared to gross treatment benefit.
				<br>
				<b>Results</b>
				<br>
			<div class="tex2jax_ignore">
				Chronic bi-weekly infusion treatment had the highest direct medical cost ($45,208) and caregiver burden ($6,095), reducing the treatment value by 44%, while oral treatment with the lowest direct medical cost ($1,983) and caregiver burden ($457) reduced the treatment value by only 2%.
				Substantial caregiver burden was reported from the survey, with a reported average of 2.3 hours for an office visit and infusion, 44 minutes of round-trip travel time, and 78% of patients being accompanied by a caregiver for treatment.
			</div>
				<br>
				<b>Conclusion</b>
				<br>
				Burden of chronic intravenous treatments exceed the gross medical and social care cost savings and value of caregiver benefit. The results suggest the need for less complex treatments that require fewer clinic visits to preserve the economic value of disease modifying treatments.

  </summary>
    For an $N \times T$ random matrix $X(\beta)$ with weakly dependent uniformly sub-Gaussian entries $x_{it}(\beta)$ that may depend on a possibly infinite-dimensional parameter $\beta\in\mathbf{B}$, we obtain a uniform bound on its operator norm of the form $\mathbb{E} \sup_{\beta \in \mathbf{B}} \|X(\beta)\| \le CK\left( \sqrt{\max(N,T)} + \gamma_2(\mathbf{B}, d_{\mathbf{B}}) \right)$, where $C$ is an absolute constant, $K$ controls the tail behavior of (the increments of) $x_{it}(\cdot)$, and $\gamma_2(\mathbf{B}, d_{\mathbf{B}})$ is Talagrand’s functional, a measure of multi-scale complexity of the metric space $(\mathbf{B}, d_{\mathbf{B}})$. We illustrate how this result may be used for estimation that seeks to minimize the operator norm of moment conditions as well as for estimation of the maximal number of factors with functional data.

	  <u>Abstract</u>
  </summary>
    We study the bias of classical quantile regression and instrumental variable quantile regression estimators. While being asymptotically first-order unbiased, these estimators can have
	non-negligible second-order biases. We derive a higher-order stochastic expansion of these estimators using empirical process theory. Based on this expansion, we derive an explicit formula for
	the second-order bias and propose a feasible bias correction procedure that uses finite-difference
	estimators of the bias components. The proposed bias correction method performs well in
	simulations. We provide an empirical illustration using Engel’s classical data on household expenditure.

	  <u>Abstract</u>
  </summary>
    In a classical model of the first-price sealed-bid auction with independent private
	values, we develop nonparametric estimation and inference procedures for a class of
	policy-relevant metrics, such as total expected surplus and expected revenue under
	counterfactual reserve prices. Motivated by the linearity of these metrics in the quantile
	function of bidders’ values, we propose a bid spacings-based estimator of the latter and
	derive its Bahadur-Kiefer expansion. This makes it possible to construct exact uniform
	confidence bands and assess the optimality of a given auction rule. Using the data on
	U.S. Forest Service timber auctions, we test whether setting zero reserve prices in these
	auctions was revenue maximizing.

	  <u>Abstract</u>
  </summary>
    For the kernel estimator of the quantile density function (the derivative of the quantile function), I show how to perform the boundary bias correction, establish the rate of
	strong uniform consistency of the bias-corrected estimator, and construct the confidence bands that are asymptotically exact uniformly over the entire domain $[0, 1]$.
	The proposed procedures rely on the pivotality of the studentized bias-corrected estimator and known anti-concentration properties of the Gaussian approximation for its supremum.

	  <u>Abstract</u>
  </summary>
	I suggest an enhancement of the procedure of Chiong, Hsieh, and Shum (2017) for calculating bounds
	on counterfactual demand in semiparametric discrete choice models. Their algorithm relies on a system
	of inequalities indexed by cycles of a large number $M$ of observed markets, and hence seems to require
	computationally infeasible enumeration of all such cycles. I show that such enumeration is unnecessary
	because solving the “fully efficient” inequality system exploiting cycles of all possible lengths $K=1,\dots,M$
	can be reduced to finding the length of the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a complete
	bidirected weighted graph on $M$ vertices. The latter problem can be solved using the Floyd–Warshall
	algorithm with computational complexity $O(M^3)$, which takes only seconds to run even for thousands of
	markets. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the efficiency gain from using cycles of all lengths, which turns
	out to be positive, but small.
