			We study the bias of classical quantile regression and instrumental variable quantile regression estimators. While being asymptotically first-order unbiased, these estimators can have
			non-negligible second-order biases. We derive a higher-order stochastic expansion of these estimators using empirical process theory. Based on this expansion, we derive an explicit formula for
			the second-order bias and propose a feasible bias correction procedure that uses finite-difference
			estimators of the bias components. The proposed bias correction method performs well in
			simulations. We provide an empirical illustration using Engel’s classical data on household expenditure.

		  </summary>
			Given a differentially private unbiased estimate $\tilde{q}=q(D) +\nu$ of a statistic $q(D)$, we wish to obtain unbiased estimates of <i>functions</i> of $q(D)$, such as $1/q(D)$, solely through post-processing of $\tilde{q}$, with no further access to the confidential dataset $D$.  To this end, we adapt the deconvolution method used for unbiased estimation in the statistical literature, deriving unbiased estimators for a broad family of twice-differentiable functions when the privacy-preserving noise $\nu$ is drawn from the Laplace distribution (Dwork <i>et al.</i>, 2006). We further extend this technique to a more general class of functions, deriving approximately optimal estimators that are unbiased for values in a user-specified interval (possibly extending to $\pm \infty$).
			We use these results to derive an unbiased estimator for private means when the size $n$ of the dataset is not publicly known. In a numerical application, we find that a mechanism that uses our estimator to return an unbiased sample size and mean outperforms a mechanism that instead uses the previously known unbiased privacy mechanism for such means (Kamath <i>et al.</i>, 2023). We also apply our estimators to develop unbiased transformation mechanisms for per-record differential privacy, a privacy concept in which the privacy guarantee is a public function of a record's value (Seeman <i>et al.</i>, 2024).  Our mechanisms provide stronger privacy guarantees than those in prior work (Finley <i>et al.</i>, 2024) by using Laplace, rather than Gaussian, noise.
			Finally, using a different approach, we go beyond Laplace noise by deriving unbiased estimators for polynomials under the weak condition that the noise distribution has sufficiently many moments.

				<u>Abstract</u>
			</summary>
				<b>Background</b>
				<br>
				Multiple disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer’s disease are currently in clinical development or have been recently approved for use. They have vastly different treatment properties but so far, little work has been done to quantify the impact of treatment properties on the treatment’s value in terms of medical and social care costs and caregiver burden.
				<br>
				<b>Objectives</b>
				<br>
				This study aims to analyze how the mode of treatment administration, treatment frequency and duration, and monitoring requirements affect the value of disease modifying treatments. In order to isolate these effects, we compare five hypothetical disease modifying treatments with equal efficacy and safety: (1) chronic bi-weekly intravenous infusion, (2) chronic four-weekly intravenous infusion, (3) 52 weeks fixed duration four-weekly intravenous infusion, (4) chronic subcutaneous injections, and (5) chronic oral prescription on their direct medical costs, caregiver burden, and preservation of treatment value.
				<br>
				<b>Design</b>
				<br>
				Survey of Alzheimer’s disease treatment clinics and retrospective data analysis.
				<br>
				<b>Setting</b>
				<br>
				United States.
				<br>
				<b>Measurements</b>
				<br>
				Direct medical cost and caregiver burden of treatment administration and monitoring compared to gross treatment benefit.
				<br>
				<b>Results</b>
				<br>
			<div class="tex2jax_ignore">
				Chronic bi-weekly infusion treatment had the highest direct medical cost ($45,208) and caregiver burden ($6,095), reducing the treatment value by 44%, while oral treatment with the lowest direct medical cost ($1,983) and caregiver burden ($457) reduced the treatment value by only 2%.
				Substantial caregiver burden was reported from the survey, with a reported average of 2.3 hours for an office visit and infusion, 44 minutes of round-trip travel time, and 78% of patients being accompanied by a caregiver for treatment.
			</div>
				<b>Conclusion</b>
				<br>
				Burden of chronic intravenous treatments exceed the gross medical and social care cost savings and value of caregiver benefit. The results suggest the need for less complex treatments that require fewer clinic visits to preserve the economic value of disease modifying treatments.

		  </summary>
			For an $N \times T$ random matrix $X(\beta)$ with weakly dependent uniformly sub-Gaussian entries $x_{it}(\beta)$ that may depend on a possibly infinite-dimensional parameter $\beta\in\mathbf{B}$, we obtain a uniform bound on its operator norm of the form $\mathbb{E} \sup_{\beta \in \mathbf{B}} \|X(\beta)\| \le CK\left( \sqrt{\max(N,T)} + \gamma_2(\mathbf{B}, d_{\mathbf{B}}) \right)$, where $C$ is an absolute constant, $K$ controls the tail behavior of (the increments of) $x_{it}(\cdot)$, and $\gamma_2(\mathbf{B}, d_{\mathbf{B}})$ is Talagrand’s functional, a measure of multi-scale complexity of the metric space $(\mathbf{B}, d_{\mathbf{B}})$. We illustrate how this result may be used for estimation that seeks to minimize the operator norm of moment conditions as well as for estimation of the maximal number of factors with functional data.

		We show how to identify the distributions of the error components in the two-way dyadic model $y_{ij} = c + \alpha_i + \eta_j + \varepsilon_{ij}$. To this end, we extend the lemma of Kotlarski (1967), mimicking the arguments of Evdokimov and White (2012). We allow the characteristic functions of the error components to have real zeros, as long as they do not overlap with zeros of their first derivatives.

		  <u>Abstract</u>
	  </summary>
		It has long been established that, if a panel dataset suffers from attrition, auxiliary (refreshment) sampling restores full identification under additional assumptions that still allow for nontrivial attrition mechanisms. Such identification results rely on implausible assumptions about the attrition process or lead to theoretically and computationally challenging estimation procedures. We propose an alternative identifying assumption that, despite its nonparametric nature, suggests a simple estimation algorithm based on a transformation of the empirical cumulative distribution function of the data. This estimation procedure requires neither tuning parameters nor optimization in the first step, i.e. has a closed form. We prove that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal and demonstrate its good performance in simulations. We provide an empirical illustration with income data from the Understanding America Study.

		  </summary>
			In a classical model of the first-price sealed-bid auction with independent private
			values, we develop nonparametric estimation and inference procedures for a class of
			policy-relevant metrics, such as total expected surplus and expected revenue under
			counterfactual reserve prices. Motivated by the linearity of these metrics in the quantile
			function of bidders’ values, we propose a bid spacings-based estimator of the latter and
			derive its Bahadur-Kiefer expansion. This makes it possible to construct exact uniform
			confidence bands and assess the optimality of a given auction rule. Using the data on
			U.S. Forest Service timber auctions, we test whether setting zero reserve prices in these
			auctions was revenue maximizing.

	  <u>Abstract</u>
  </summary>
	I suggest an enhancement of the procedure of Chiong, Hsieh, and Shum (2017) for calculating bounds
	on counterfactual demand in semiparametric discrete choice models. Their algorithm relies on a system
	of inequalities indexed by cycles of a large number $M$ of observed markets, and hence seems to require
	computationally infeasible enumeration of all such cycles. I show that such enumeration is unnecessary
	because solving the “fully efficient” inequality system exploiting cycles of all possible lengths $K=1,\dots,M$
	can be reduced to finding the length of the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a complete
	bidirected weighted graph on $M$ vertices. The latter problem can be solved using the Floyd–Warshall
	algorithm with computational complexity $O(M^3)$, which takes only seconds to run even for thousands of
	markets. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the efficiency gain from using cycles of all lengths, which turns
	out to be positive, but small.
